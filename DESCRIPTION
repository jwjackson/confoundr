Description: This software implements three covariate-balance diagnostics for time-varying confounding and selection-bias in complex longitudinal data, as described in Jackson 2016 <doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000547> and Jackson 2019 <doi: 10.1093/aje/kwz136>. Diagnostic 1 assesses measured confounding/selection-bias, diagnostic 2 assesses exposure-covariate feedback, and diagnostic 3 assesses residual confounding/selection-bias after inverse probability weighting or propensity score stratification. All diagnostics appropriately account for exposure history, can be adapted to assess a particular depth of covariate history, and can be implemented in right-censored data. Balance assessments can be obtained for all times, selected-times, or averaged across person-time. The balance measures are reported as tables or plots. These diagnostics can be applied to the study of multivariate exposures including time-varying exposures, direct effects, interaction, and censoring.
